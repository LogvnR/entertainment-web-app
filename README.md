## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Js with Types
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - For State Management

### What I learned

In this project I learned the basics of using TypeScript in a full project, and also using Zustand to manage app wide state. I particularly paid close attention to writing DRY, clean, and efficient Js code
